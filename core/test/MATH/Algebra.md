The Permutation Representation

%

$$
\begin{aligned}
&G\to\text{Perm}(G)\\
&g\leadsto m_g\text{ - left multiplication by }g
\end{aligned}
$$
defined by this operation is injective.

**Cayley's Theorem**.

Every finite group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a permutation group. A group of order $n$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_n$.
